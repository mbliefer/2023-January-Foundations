				<h3>Courses</h3>
				<dl>
					<dt>Do I need experience?</dt>
					<dd>
						For the Basics of Web Development course, no - this course will teach you everything you need to know. 
						For the Mobile Web Development Course, yes - you should have a solid understanding of both HTML & CSS, 
						including using advanced selectors like nth-of-type and :target.
					</dd>
					<dt>Do I need to install any software?</dt>
					<dd>
						You only need Chrome - everything will be presented online, and you will use our online development 
						platform for all coding work.
					</dd>
					<dt>Is this course hard?</dt>
					<dd>
						Maybe - kinda depends on you! The material is presented in a very step-by-step manner as it 
						guides you through new topics while you are developing a real website. Remember that these are 
						also self-paced courses, so if you need to review a section multiple times to really "get it", 
						you can.
					</dd>
					<dt>How long is the course?</dt>
					<dd>
						Courses are open from the first of the month for 31 days, and each course is divided into about 
						8-10 sections, so you typically have about 3 days on average to complete each section. Each section 
						can take anywhere from 1-4 hours to complete.
					</dd>
					<dt>What is the course material like?</dt>
					<dd><a href="sample.html" target="_blank">Here is a sample!</a></dd>
